# Pastebin Guide – Getting Started

## Introduction
Pastebin is an online platform for sharing plain text or code snippets. It's commonly used by developers, researchers, and anyone who wants to quickly share text online. You can use it for notes, code snippets, or even small secret messages (more on that below).

## Creating a Paste
1. Once logged in, click **New Paste**.  
2. Enter your text or code in the **Paste Content** box.  
3. Optional: Select the syntax highlighting for your code (e.g., Python, JavaScript).  
4. For privacy:

   - **Unlisted**: Only people with the link can access it.
   - **Private**: Only you can view it (requires a Pastebin Pro account).

## Sharing Secret Messages (Optional)
For additional security, you can encode your text before pasting. A simple method is **Base64 encoding**:

1. Convert your message to Base64 using any online encoder or a simple script.  
2. Paste the encoded text into Pastebin.  
3. Share the link with trusted recipients, who can then decode the message.  

This adds an extra layer of protection if your paste is unlisted or public.

## Finding Users and Their Pastes
You can explore other users' pastes if they are public. Some tips:

- Direct URL to a user’s pastes:  
  If your username is `potato`, you can access all your public pastes at: https://pastebin.com/u/potato


- Direct URL to a user’s pastes:
